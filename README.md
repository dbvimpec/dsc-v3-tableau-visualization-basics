# Tableau - Useful Visualizations

## Introduction
Tableau offers many visualizations for communicating your data to viewers and stakeholders. In this lesson, we will highlight a few of these vizes that are likely to be used more often. We will take a look at the types of data necessary for each of these very useful vizzes.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Choose a viz from the Show Me Pane
* Identify the data type necessary for a specific viz
* Apply different aggregations and ordering

## Show Me Pane
The _Show Me Pane_ contains the selection of visualizations you have to choose from for your worksheet. Once you have selected data to display, Tableau will begin highlighting the vizzes that are compatible with the type of data selected. If you are not sure of the type of data needed for a viz you can hover over the viz in the Show Me Pane and Tableau will show suggestions for the type of data suitable.

## Line Chart
In previous lessons we have focused on the bar chart, but Tableau has many vizzes to choose from. Let's take a look at the _Scatter Plot_ which is useful for visualizing the relation of one measure to another, such as the average _Quantity_ in relation to _Profit_. If you hover over the image for the _Scatter Plot_ in the _Show Me Pane_ you will see that Tableau suggests __2-4 Measures__ and __0 Dimensions__.
